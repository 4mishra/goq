* TODO
** Task Storage
 The storage should provide efficient task retrieval and support atomic operations.

** Task Producer
Implement a component that allows producers to enqueue tasks. This component should provide an interface to accept tasks, assign them unique identifiers, and store them in the task storage for later processing.

** Task Consumer
Develop a component that consumes tasks from the queue. It should continuously monitor the task storage for new tasks and process them according to the defined business logic. Consider using concurrent processing to handle multiple tasks concurrently, leveraging Go's goroutines and channels.

** Task Prioritization
Implement a mechanism to prioritize tasks based on their importance or urgency.
We can assign different priority levels to tasks and ensure that consumers process higher priority tasks before lower priority ones.

** Task Monitoring
Include monitoring capabilities to track task status, processing time, and other metrics. This can help with debugging, performance optimization, and identifying potential bottlenecks in the system.

** Task Acknowledgment
Implement an acknowledgment mechanism to ensure task reliability. Consumers should acknowledge the successful processing of a task, allowing the system to handle failures or reprocessing scenarios.

** Task Retry and Error Handling
Design a mechanism to handle task failures and retries. Implement an exponential backoff strategy to retry failed tasks, considering scenarios like network issues, temporary failures, or dependencies.

** Distributed Task Queue (Optional)
If we want to scale the task queue system across multiple machines or nodes, we can explore distributed systems concepts like sharding, load balancing, and message replication to achieve fault tolerance and high availability.

** Monitoring and Administration
Provide an interface or API for monitoring and administration of the task queue system. This can include features like real-time task status updates, visibility into task processing metrics, and the ability to pause, resume, or cancel tasks.
